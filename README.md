Diagnosing Malaria: A Comparison of Transfer Learning Approaches on the NIH Malaria Dataset with Grad-CAM Visualization for Interpretable AI.

<div align="justify"> Malaria is a lethal disease that disproportionately affects sub-Saharan Africa. Current diagnostic
methods, such as microscopy, are labor-intensive and susceptible to human errors. Machine
learning offers promising potential for enhancing automated medical imaging techniques in
malaria diagnosis. In this research, we evaluated the efficacy of transfer learning in
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compared to a baseline Random Forest model for
classifying malaria-infected cells using the NIH Malaria dataset. Additionally, we investigated
the influence of ImageNet weights on the VGG19 CNN model's performance.</div> .

<div align="justify">We employed Grad-CAM visualization to generate saliency representations of malaria-infected cells and
assessed their interpretability. Our findings revealed that the VGG19 CNN model, when
augmented with ImageNet weights, outperformed other models in accuracy. Moreover, the
Grad-CAM visualization offered valuable insights into the CNN model's decision-making
process by emphasizing crucial areas for classification. Our research not only establishes that
deep learning can effectively enhance automated malaria diagnosis but also contributes to our
understanding of disease diagnosis through its interpretability.</div>
